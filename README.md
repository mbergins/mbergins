Hello, I'm a research scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I work on problems related to bioinformatics. I've worked in several subfiends of bioinformatics such as image analysis and multiomics data analysis. I mostly work in R. You can find out more about my work at my website (https://matthew.berginski.com/) along with ways to contact me.
