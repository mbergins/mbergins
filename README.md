Hello, I'm a computational biologist at Tempus Labs where I work on problems related to bioinformatics. I've worked in several subfiends of bioinformatics such as image analysis and multiomics data analysis. I mostly work in R, but also have experience with python, MATLAB and perl. You can find out more about my work at my website (https://matthew.berginski.com/) along with ways to contact me.
